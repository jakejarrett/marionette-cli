# Support for per-project config
* ~~Ideally via something like .mnrc~~
* CLI Pass through --config "file"
    * Support relative and absolute paths
    * Would supersede all other config files
    * Can be passed through with other options (EG/ mt set es6 --config "file")
* "dir" option for where the base directory is located (Eg/ mt -g view NewFolderName which would be ~/dev/project/some/deeper/folder/NewFolderName/)

# Support for custom boilerplate
* Configured inside of .mnrc
