# Support for per-project config
* Ideally via something like .mnrc
* CLI Pass through --config "file"
    * Support relative and absolute paths
    * Would supersede all other config files
    * Can be passed through with other options (EG/ mt set es6 --config "file")

# Support for custom boilerplate
* Configured inside of .mnrc
